"About" pages are often embellished, but I prefer straightforward sincerity. This is my story: a candid reflection of my journey in technology.

My fascination with coding ignited at age 7, delving into GameShark codes for Pokemon Red version. This early exploration was more than a childhood pastime; it was the spark that ignited a deep-rooted interest in technology.

By age 12, I had progressed from simple game hacks to the rudiments of web development. During this time, my inspiration came from figures like Andrew Gower, whose creation of RuneScape (at the time, a browser based game) represented a fusion of creativity and technical skill that resonated with me. Similarly, John Carmack's pioneering work in game development and graphics was a beacon, guiding my own future endeavors in modding games and writing code. This period was rich with experimentation, laying the foundational stones of my future in tech.

High school, beginning in 2004, was a crucial phase of development and application for me. I ventured into private server software development for online games; working hard to grasp the inner workings of packet transfer, TCP, and the client/server relationship. It was an ambitious learning process that was heavily inspired by my admiration from Gower's technical ingenuity and creativity in building RuneScape. This was a time of learning and growth, where my coding skills expanded alongside my academic pursuits. The challenges and triumphs of developing server software were instrumental in shaping my future in technology.

In college, starting in 2008, my journey took a more sophisticated turn. Influenced by work being done in the world of game engines and real-time web technology of that era (and the fusion between the two), I continued to refine my skills in software development, with a heavier focus on web technologies. This period was marked by a blend of academic learning and practical application, as I juggled my roles as a graveyard shift Game Master at Sony Online Entertainment, a part time student, and freelance web developer.

The grind paid off. After some very sleepless years, I was hired onto the platform team at Sony. Here I participated in multiple AAA game launches and exciting technical projects that expanded my horizons. The rest, as they say, is history. Since then, I have navigated through diverse roles in both startups and established tech companies, contributed to cutting-edge projects and have led innovative teams.

Looking ahead, my ambition is not just to advance in the field of technology but to leave a lasting impact. Still shaped by those influences from my past, along with the faces of new, I continue to draw inspiration from the ever-evolving tech landscape. Individuals such as Sam Altman, Emmett Shear, Lex Fridman, and others are examples of the ingenuity I aspire to. My journey, marked by constant learning and adaptation, reflects my commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Whether through developing groundbreaking software or mentoring the next generation of technologists, my goal remains: to innovate, inspire, and drive progress in an industry that never stands still.
